# LizardWizard
Compact Lizard Cult outcast utility for use with Leder Games' Root on TTS

-------------------------
Everyone who's played a game opposite a Lizard Cult player knows the faction comes with one fatal flaw:
No, not the part where they're really difficult to win with. The flaw of having to constantly remind yourself to send every discarded card all the way across the table rather than discarding it normally. Suboptimal!

This mod copies the same script used in the Lizard faction board, but puts it in a compact tile you can keep right next to the regular discard pile. I also fixed that bug where the board wouldn't update if you only had one card on it.

USAGE:
From the "games" menu, click the three-dots icon on this mod, and select "Additive load".

This project was derived from Mr McChew's "Root + All Expansions" mod at:

You can use my project outside of McChew's mod, but I don't know why you would.
